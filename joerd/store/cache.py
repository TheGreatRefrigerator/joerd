    Every tile that gets generated requires ETOPO1. And most require a GMTED

    re-download them every time (ETOPO1 alone is 446MB), we cache ETOPO1 and
    GMTED.

    This is a bit of a hack, and would be better replaced by a generic
    fixed-size LRU/LFU cache. Even better if the cache could be shared
    between multiple Joerd processes on the same host.
